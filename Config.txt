### Config file for Krypton Calibration Analyzer ###

# This file is for holding application-specific constants. It is
# parsed by KryptonAnalyzer. This configuration file is expected to be
# in the directory in which KryptonAnalyzer is run. Users may override
# this by providing the path to a valid configuration file using the
# '-c [path-to-config]' option.

# Lines in this file beginning with a '#' will be ignored. Enjoy!

# TPCs to run in.

# Type of fit function to use. Either 'Gaussian' or 'Fermi'.

# Gaussian fit will determine peak position, find regions above and
# below where the histogram drops by a factor of 2, and fit a
# Gaussian.  Fermi fit will determine the location of the falling edge
# of the spectrum. This method is more reliable if the main peak is
# not easilly visible.
fitFunction Fermi

# Minimum ADC value for acceptable Krypton peak. Peaks below this will
# be considered noise peaks. Fermi function fit to the end of the
# spectrum will use the largest peak above this value as the beginning
# of the "turn-off" point. Check your data!!

# Acceptable limits on calculated pad gains. Gains outside these
# limits will be written as -1, meaning the pad will be ignored in
# dEdx calculation, cluster position estimation, etc.
minAcceptableGain 0.5
maxAcceptableGain 2.5

# Minimum number of entries in histogram to attempt calibration.
minHistogramEntries 200

# Number of bins in pad histogram. Decrease if your data has fewer
# events.
histogramBins 100

# Pad histogram ranges will be from zero to
# [HistogramPadding]*[minADCPeakSearch] (in ADCs).
histogramPadding 3.0

# Cluster cuts to get rid of noise. Tune as desired.
